It's been affecting me to the point where I've been venting my complaints to others, and I'm afraid of being disliked if I continue like this. Maybe I should write out my complaints. I might end up writing some really awful things, but I hope someone can empathize with me. Being alone is scary. Viewer discretion advised: This text may hurt someone.

If you play the recorder poorly, the music teacher will shout loudly during detention. Even though it's nothing now, it was very scary for me when I was an elementary school student. Every time I made a strange mistake, the class fell silent and I was looked at with disdain. If someone tried to defend me, they too would be looked at with disdain. From the days of \"everyone getting along\" in first and second grade elementary school, to becoming \"who is the well-behaved one\" in third grade, one day I didn't want to go to school. But today I will go to school. Overwhelmed by the anxiety of being scolded again, I reach the nearest station to school. The three-minute walk of two hundred and some meters feels heavy on my body.","link":"https://note.com/soto9/n/n6982774784d5","isoDate":"2022-05-09T14:18:50.000Z","og":"https://assets.st-note.com/production/uploads/images/78218452/rectangle_large_type_2_fe310ddc31b61df55033c04dc1c7bd69.jpeg?fit=bounds&quality=85&width=1280","dateMiliSeconds":1652105930000},{"title":"【ATO2】Air Tycoon Online 2 Credit Earning Guide","contentSnippet":"※This article is currently being written, so the content may change in the future.
